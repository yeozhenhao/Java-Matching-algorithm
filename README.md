# yeozhenhao's Matching Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithm on Java for Delicacies Matchmaking
### About my first Java project

##### <ins>About Delicacies Matchmaking</ins>
###### A Telegram app to chat anonymously with potential dates:
Delicacies Matchmaking is a Singapore-wide anonymous dating event for university students, with an average of 400+ signups per event. I run it every few months and the idea was conceived & actualized solely by me in Dec 2021. It is a 100% online Telegram event where every participant gets two random and anonymous matches that fit their Gender, Age, Race, Religion & Relationship preferences *(matching is done with a Depth First Search algorithm)*. Participants have **one month** to chat with their matches, and it will be up to them to reveal their identities before the app is taken down.

Matches chat anonymously with one another through two Telegram bots, one for each match. The bots enable anonymity, which helps to lower the consequences of making a bad first impression or faux pas. To break the ice, matches can find out more about each other through details they have declared at sign-up such as **Two Truths One Lie, Fun Facts, Interests, Dealbreakers** & **responses to 40 fun icebreaker questions**. An example of the 40 icebreaker questions can be seen [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1k2IsHvhYo4gminzRAg9qW_9qqUREXl0brioESlH1_B4/edit?usp=sharing).

According to my Delicacies Matchmaking PDPA policy, we destroy all online & offline sign-up and matchmaking data after every event.

###### The bots will be taken down at the end of the month:
Interested matches can decide to reveal their Telegram usernames to each other to continue chatting, and uninterested matches can decide against revealing. After the bots are taken down, all the online & offline sign-up and matching data is destroyed, so the participants will never know who their matches are.

> To reveal or not to reveal â€” it is completely up to the participants

##### <ins>Why I created an algorithm in Java</ins>
Having seen that Delicacies has helped successfully matched couples from hearsay, I dreamt of turning Delicacies Matchmaking into an actual mobile dating app.
However, I knew one of the biggest challenge is to create a matchmaking algorithm in Java, as the current Python matchmaking algorithm could not be used on native platforms such as Java on Android.
Thus, I set out to do something crazy: **recreating a Depth-First Search algorithm from scratch by myself, in the Java coding language that I have never touched before**

##### <ins>The pain and reward of learning a new coding language</ins>
Sure enough, I faced many challenges which although enriching, were extremely *painful*.
I not only had to learn all the new Java objects, coding structure, syntaxes and more, I also had to dabble quite deep in Graph Theory Data Structures with the Java module [JGraphT](https://jgrapht.org/) to use a Strongly Connected Components algorithm to eventually make a fast matchmaking algorithm.  

For example, the first task I embarked on was to create functions that "simply" import the Excel player list data into Java as Java objects, which would then be evaluated through the Depth-First Search algorithm.
Turns out, this was not simple at all as this first task took **12 hours** as I was stuck on following outdated tutorials on how to use OpenCSV module in Java, and was also not used to the Builder types of classes in Java (which hardly existed in Python).
The OpenCSV module is essential in importing Excel data as Java objects.
Thus, after several hours of trial and error with OpenCSV module's many Builder and MappingStrategy classes, I finally got it to work after 12 hours of working on the project, but it nearly destroyed my confidence in completing this project.
I thought to myself, *"How can I complete this project if I took 1 day just to import an Excel file?"*
I almost gave up on this project.

Now that I have completed the project after **6 full days** of working on this project, I am glad I pushed through the thousands of runtime errors I encountered, as I finally now understood the capabilities, coding structure and even limitations of Java.

##### <ins>What I learnt about Java</ins>
Java is really the bigger and more efficient brother of Python.
The numerous classes with builder classes, Java bean objects, and Java really gives you almost unlimited capability to create and process anything you want in a much faster way than Python.
One example is Java's ability to concurrently run functions (the concurrent processing feature of Java), whereas Python only runs one function at any time in a script.
Although the concurrent processing feature of Java was not used in this algorithm, the algorithm ran noticeably faster than the Python algorithm in matchmaking over 300 players.

The drawback for efficiency is that you have to declare every single intuitive part of the script.\
Every single Java variable/class had to be declared specifically what type(s) of data they should accept.
To illustrate, to create a Python tuple object (i.e. a collection which is ordered and unchangeable), you simply create it by declaring\
`tuple_test = (Player01, Player02)`\
where "Player01" and "Player02" are Player objects.\
However, in Java you had use the Pair Java data structure by declaring:\
`Pair<Player,Player> tuple_test = new Pair<> (Player01, Player02)`\
(meaning tuple_test is of the Java object/class Pair which can accept a tuple of Player objects) before you could use tuple_test in the matchmaking algorithm.

The other drawback for having much more data structures is the  
 
For instance, I learnt that Java is much more advanced than Python in that if you tried to run algorithms that required Java to process over **300,000 Java ordered lists** of player data, Eclipse (the IDE that I used to code and run this Java script) will freeze and give an *OutOfMemory* Java error.\
In Python algorithms, you do not need to worry about memory management as it is automatically done for you. But in Java, you have to manually manage the memory usage. I eventually fixed this problem by throwing away a huge percentage of the Java lists that I know would likely be useless. (I will explain this error in detail later in this article)

### About the Algorithm
##### <ins>Why I made my repository public</ins>
My Python coding skills was developed by heavily studying & recoding the [public repository of the Python matchmaking algorithm by Sriram Sami](https://github.com/frizensami/archangel), which I implemented in my Delicacies Matchmaking project.\
Hence, I wish to give back to the community by sharing the matchmaking algorithm in Java coding language for anyone interested to learn about algorithms in Java using *Graph Theory Data Structures*.

Thus, I will explain every part of my algorithm in Java henceforth.
